# The Man and the Coprse

The man was walking on the sidewalk when suddenly a **giant living corpse** jumped out of a _deep dark doorway_. It started spitting and drooling and asked the man 3 questions:
1. Where is my heart?
2. Kiss me?
3. What's a quote?
The man was disgusted with the smell that emerged and said, go wash yourself first and then i will answer all of your questions.


_While the corpse grasped for carbon dioxide, he reached for his head as if he was thinking_
_**Then he frantically started cleaning himself with his spit and drool**_
_After which he did not wait for answers from the man but asked 3 questions himself:_


1. Can you smell your heart now?
2. Lick me?
3. What's a line of code?
