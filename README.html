<h1>The Lady And The Mirror</h1>

<p>
  <b>She</b> was wandering in the neverending streets of her dreamworld in
  search for some <i>light</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Every step she did, made her more hopeless and drained. She succummed and fell
  to her knees crying out loud.
</p>
<p>
  Engulfed by the feeling of darkness, she finally looked up and saw the
  brightest light she ever saw.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It was coming from a glass window.</li>
  <li>She ran closer and saw her own face, deeply saddend.</li>
  <li>
    To her surpside it was her that was <b>beaming the brighest light!</b>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly a giant rock hit the window and gone was the light.</p>

<p>
  It was dark. You gotta know, she had lived her entire life in a dark cave,
  deep underneath the earth's surface
</p>
<p>
  In the end she had never really seen light, - not pure light anyway. She
  passed her existence in darkness.
</p>
<p>And odd as it may sound, but she lived in her own darkness by choice</p>

<h2>The healing power of ying and yang</h2>

<p>
  But then again, no one ever lives their entire life just in just darkness
  <strong>Life in itself is pure light</strong>
