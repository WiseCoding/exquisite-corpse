<h1>The Lady And The Mirror</h1>

<p><b>She</b> was wandering in the neverending streets of her dreamworld in search for some <i>light</i>.</p>
<p>Every step she did, made her more hopeless and drained. She succummed and fell to her knees crying out loud.</p>
<p>Engulfed by the feeling of darkness, she finally looked up and saw the brightest light she ever saw.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It was coming from a glass window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She ran closer and saw her own face, deeply saddend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To her surpside it was her that was <b>beaming the brighest light!</b></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<p>Suddenly a giant rock hit the window and gone was the light. </p>

<p> It was dark. You gotta know, she had lived her entire life in a dark cave, deep underneath the earth's surface</p>
<p> In the end she had never really seen light, - not pure light anyway. She passed her existence in darkness.</p>
<p> And odd as it may sound, but she lived in her own darkness by choice</p>
